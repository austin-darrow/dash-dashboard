This application pulls data from an internal TACC database as massive Excel files. Then, using the Pandas and Plotly Dash libraries, and an Nginx web server, it creates a visual, interactive data dashboard with filters, charts, and graphs.

The web app is currently hosted [here](http://129.114.38.28:8050).
